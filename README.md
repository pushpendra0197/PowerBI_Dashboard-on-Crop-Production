![Crop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bb38147-fa1d-4d6d-a6e9-37951f130e4c)## Crop Production Dashboard -
i have created Dashboard on Crop production dataset 2010-2015. in which i cleaned the data first because data contained the blank,missing values and irrelevant rows. Than after i 
divided data into facts and dimension for better analysis. Then i created relationship between the table in model view. then i used different types of charts for data visulization.
Reason of creating the dashboard to understand the data better in better way by seeing visuals because visuals gives clear insights of data as compares to Raw data.

After using Card KPI i found that the total number of crop perticular state is producing.
I also found the how many district is contributing in state for crop production.
I also used line chart to see the total production year by year.
